#In Python, a list is a built-in dynamic sized array (automatically grows and shrinks). We can store all types of items (including another list) in a list. 
#A list may contain mixed type of items, this is possible because a list mainly stores references at contiguous locations and actual items maybe stored at different locations.

#List can contain duplicate items.
#List in Python are Mutable. Hence, we can modify, replace or delete the items.
#List are ordered. It maintain the order of elements based on how they are added.
#Accessing items in List can be done directly using their position (index), starting from 0.

# Creating a Python list with different data types

a = [10, 20, "GfG", 40, True]

print(a)

# Checking types of elements
print(type(a[2]))  # str
print(type(a[4]))  # bool
