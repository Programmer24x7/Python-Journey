# prompt: create a example of for loop

# For Loop Example (Corrected)
# The previous loop was modifying the loop variable 'a' which is generally not
# recommended and can lead to unexpected behavior. This example iterates over
# a list of numbers.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
  print(f"Current number: {num}")

#output:
Current number: 1
Current number: 2
Current number: 3
Current number: 4
Current number: 5
